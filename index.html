      Racial inequality is rooted in historical contexts like colonialism and slavery, which created deep-seated disparities that persist today.
       The notion of "race" emerged and evolved significantly alongside European colonization and the transatlantic slave trade.
       The idea that "white" people were inherently superior to "non-white" people became a widespread belief. 
       The treatment of indigenous people when Europeans landed on American shores demonstrates this.
       Policies like Segregaion, Apartheid, the Jim Crow Laws, the Chinese Excluion Acts and Immigration Quotas support the idea that one race is lesser than the other.
